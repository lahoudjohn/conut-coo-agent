# Objectives

This folder groups the backend by the five hackathon business objectives.

- `objective1_combo/`: Combo optimization
- `objective2_forecast/`: Demand forecasting by branch
- `objective3_expansion/`: Expansion feasibility
- `objective4_staffing/`: Shift staffing estimation
- `objective5_growth/`: Coffee and milkshake growth strategy

Each objective exposes a `service.py` entrypoint that the API layer can import directly.
